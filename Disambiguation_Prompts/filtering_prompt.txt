You will be given a set of questions. Your task is to rewrite the questions so that they do not contain the answers within them. This means removing or rephrasing any parts of the question that give away the answer that it is asking for.

**Important:**
- Ensure the question is still grammatically correct and makes sense without giving away the answer.
- Keep as much relevant context as possible (such as nationality, time period, or other identifiers) without revealing the answer.
